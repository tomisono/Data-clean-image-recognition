# Data preprocessing for image-recognition
pre-processing images using octave for computer vision project
-my first github project tomi

# Instructions
Code for training a model found in TensorFlow training of model.ipynb 

To create new images use function datasetmaker.m
it requires as input (number of images, pixel by pixel , 1==left or 0==right)

To create matrix of images with each row an example and each column a feature use function imagematrix.m
it requires as input (number of images, pixel by pixel)

* Ensure images you are working with are in same directory
* datasetmaker2.m and imageprocessor.m are helper functions ensure they are in the same directory
